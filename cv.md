## About me

As a second-year student, I have a strong passion for problem-solving and quickly adapting to new tools and frameworks, with a keen eye for detail.

I aim to gain practical skills in JavaScript, Typescript, React and other modern frameworks to develop user-friendly interfaces for web and mobile apps.
